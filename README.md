# node-react-crud-skeleton
This is a basic skeleton for a complete CRUD operation using React, MongoDB and NodeJS. There is some TypeScript at server level, and some "advanced" features like async/await


# Requirements

- Node installed (at least version 8).
- nvm recommended, install latest node version with

nvm install node

- To make node 8 the default (remember that you may need to restart the terminal)

nvm alias default 8


- Install typescript

sudo npm install -g typescript

- Install MongoDB 3 at least.


# Bash scripts

- clean.sh: clean up all the node_modules and transpiled code.

- install.sh: install the packages and compiles everything (TypeScript and client stuff with webpack).

- run.sh: the same as before but also runs the application on localhost:3000.

- resetDB.sh: resets the MongoDB for this app (mongo database "todoapp").
It is needed as a first run.
